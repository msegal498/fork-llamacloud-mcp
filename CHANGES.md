# PDF Chunking System - Implementation Changes

## Core Issues Fixed

1. **FastMCP API Compatibility**
   - Added fallback logic to handle different versions of the MCP library
   - Created flexible initialization that works with various FastMCP implementations
   - Added attribute checks for different ways to access the FastAPI app

2. **Path Resolution Issues**
   - Replaced all relative paths with absolute paths using Path.resolve()
   - Added project root directory detection and setting
   - Fixed static file directory references in the frontend server

3. **Environment and Configuration**
   - Added better error handling for missing API keys
   - Created fallback modes for LlamaCloud and OpenAI integration
   - Added test scripts to verify environment setup

4. **Robust PDF Processing**
   - Enhanced error handling in PDF extraction and chunking
   - Added step-by-step status updates during processing
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for summarization when API keys are missing

5. **Documentation**
   - Added detailed troubleshooting guide
   - Created fallback configuration examples
   - Added instructional batch files for easy startup
